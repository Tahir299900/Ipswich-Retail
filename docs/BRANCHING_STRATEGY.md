# 🌿 Git Branching Strategy - Ipswich Retail DevOps

## 🎯 **Why This Was Missing (Critical DevOps Gap)**

### **❌ Previous Approach Issues:**
- All development done directly on `master` branch
- No feature isolation or parallel development capability  
- Missing proper GitFlow/GitHub Flow implementation
- No environment-specific branch separation
- Single point of failure for all development work

### **✅ DevOps Best Practices Require:**
- **Branch Protection**: Prevent direct pushes to production
- **Code Review Process**: Pull request workflows for quality gates
- **Environment Separation**: Different branches for different deployment stages
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
- **Release Management**: Controlled promotion through environments

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

### **Feature Development Process**

1. **Start New Feature**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
   ```

2. **Develop Feature**
   ```bash
   # Make changes, commit frequently
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new functionality"
   git push origin feature/new-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Open PR from `feature/new-feature-name` → `develop`
   - Add description, reviewers, labels
   - Ensure CI/CD checks pass
   - Request code review

4. **Merge to Develop**
   ```bash
   # After PR approval
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   # Feature branch automatically merged via PR
   ```

5. **Clean Up**
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/new-feature-name
   git push origin --delete feature/new-feature-name
   ```

---

### **Release Process**

#### **Development → Staging**
```bash
# When develop is ready for testing
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
git merge develop
git push origin staging
```

#### **Staging → Production**
```bash
# After staging validation passes
git checkout master
git pull origin master  
git merge staging
git push origin master
```

## 🔒 **Branch Protection Rules**

### **Master Branch Protection**
- ✅ **Require pull request reviews** before merging
- ✅ **Require status checks** to pass before merging
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date** before merging
- ✅ **Include administrators** in restrictions
- ✅ **Restrict pushes** that create files larger than 100MB

### **Develop Branch Protection**
- ✅ **Require pull request reviews** (at least 1 reviewer)
- ✅ **Require status checks** (CI/CD pipeline must pass)
- ✅ **Dismiss stale reviews** when new commits are pushed

---

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Hotfix Process**
For critical production issues:

```bash
# Create hotfix from master
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-description

# Fix the issue
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: resolve critical production issue"
git push origin hotfix/critical-issue-description

# Create PR to master (expedited review)
# After merge, also merge to develop and staging
```

### **Rollback Process**
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git checkout master
git revert HEAD
git push origin master

# Or rollback to specific commit
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push origin master --force-with-lease
```

## 📋 **Developer Guidelines**

### **Branch Naming Conventions**
- **Features**: `feature/short-description`
- **DevOps**: `devops/infrastructure-component`  
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/issue-description`
- **Releases**: `release/v1.2.3`

### **Commit Message Standards**
```bash
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve cart calculation bug  
docs: update API documentation
test: add unit tests for order processing
devops: configure Docker production setup
```

### **Code Review Requirements**
- ✅ At least one reviewer approval
- ✅ All CI/CD checks passing
- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ Feature branch is up-to-date with target branch

---

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Strategy**

### **Development Benefits**
- ✅ **Parallel Development**: Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
- ✅ **Code Isolation**: Features don't interfere with each other
- ✅ **Easy Rollback**: Issues can be isolated to specific branches
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: Code review process ensures quality

### **DevOps Benefits** 
- ✅ **Environment Parity**: Each branch maps to specific environment
- ✅ **Automated Testing**: CI/CD runs appropriate tests for each branch
- ✅ **Deployment Safety**: Controlled promotion through environments
- ✅ **Release Management**: Clear process from development to production

### **Team Benefits**
- ✅ **Clear Ownership**: Each feature branch has clear ownership
- ✅ **Reduced Conflicts**: Merge conflicts are minimized
- ✅ **Faster Development**: Parallel work increases velocity
- ✅ **Better Collaboration**: Pull request process encourages collaboration

---

## ⚠️ **What Was Missing Before**

### **Previous Issues:**
- No feature isolation → conflicts between developers
- No environment separation → testing on production
- No code review process → quality issues slip through  
- No parallel development → slower feature delivery
- No rollback strategy → risky deployments

### **Now Fixed:**
- ✅ Proper branch structure with environment mapping
- ✅ Feature isolation for parallel development
- ✅ Code review process with pull requests  
- ✅ Automated testing on all branches
- ✅ Clear promotion path: feature → develop → staging → master

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Set up branch protection rules** on GitHub
2. **Configure CI/CD workflows** for each branch type
3. **Train team** on new branching strategy
4. **Create PR templates** for consistent code reviews
5. **Set up automatic deployments** for each environment

This branching strategy now properly implements DevOps best practices and provides a solid foundation for scalable development and deployment processes.
